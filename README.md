# Project 10 - Full Stack App with React and a REST API
 Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 10 - Full Stack App with React and a REST API

In this project, I've used React to create a client for the school database REST API I created in another project. The full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.
In addition, the project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

To complete this project, I used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

Key achievements:
-- Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for the application in a modular fashion.
-- Used React Router to set up routes.
-- Used Axios to fetch data from my REST API.
-- Allowed users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
-- Added to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
